## LAMA? Location-Aware Movement [Here](https://github.com/dirthsj/LAMA/wiki)
    - turtles get fucked if world closes while they're mid operation - can forget where they are and what direction they're facing
    - looks like LAMA solves that
    - this is definitely deprecated - ignore this!
        - we'll just maintain persistence ourselves with our own smart libraries


## Example (very complicated & library-dependent) tree farm [Here](https://github.com/Lupus590-CC/CC-TreeFarm/tree/master)


## [Merlib](https://github.com/merlinlikethewizard/Shacktuator/tree/main/merlib) - our library we'll probably use

    - click the saves folder, which contains info about particular worlds
    - go into the world you want to turn fuel off for, then go to the serverconfig folder
        - open the computercraft-server.toml file
